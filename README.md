# Directus Router Plugin

The **Directus Router** Plugin is an extension for [Grav CMS](http://github.com/getgrav/grav). redirects expired urls to new routes configured in directus

This extension reads routing data from a directus backend and reroutes deprecated urls and requres the [directus2 plugin](https://github.com/zebra-group/grav-plugin-directus2).

## Configuration

Before configuring this plugin, you should copy the `user/plugins/directus2-router/directus-router.yaml` to `user/config/plugins/directus2-router.yaml` and only edit that copy.

Here is the default configuration and an explanation of available options:

```yaml
enabled: true
track_unknown: false
mapping:
  table: routing_table
  request_field: field_for_deprecated_url
  target_field: field_for_target_site
  status_field: field_for_status_code
  page_instance_field: optional_field_for_instancing
additionalFilters:
  some_field.id:
    operator: _eq
    value: 1
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| track_unknown | add unknown routes that not match existing pages or routes as drafts (data graveyard ahead!) |
| table | the table name of the routing data |
| request_field | the route of the deprecated url |
| target_field | the new url for the redirect |
| status_field | the status code field. (example value is 301 for permanently moved) |
| page_instance_field | can be used if you run multiple frontend (e.g. for subsidaries) |
| additionalFilters | here you can specify some more filter options. The syntax is the same as in the directus plugin |

Note that if you use the Admin Plugin, a file with your configuration named directus-router.yaml will be saved in the `user/config/plugins/`-folder once the configuration is saved in the Admin.
